Let me know if you'd like to add user greeting like **‚ÄúWelcome, Account #123456‚Äù** or want me to wire this into `sweepout.php` too!

Let me know if you want to also animate the balance or pull in recent transactions below it. That would make it feel even more like a real bank dashboard.

Let me know if you‚Äôd like:

Sidebar navigation instead of grid

Modal profile/settings panel

Notifications from DB or JSON

Light/dark theme toggle

Let me know if you'd like QR code, avatar, or personalization enhancements!

Want me to also include:

Sweep log viewer below the button?

Option to undo sweep (maybe limited time)?

Animation when sweeping happens (money flying or balance glowing)?

Let me know and I‚Äôll add itIf you want, send me your current sweepout.php code ‚Äî I‚Äôll refactor and send you a visually balanced version with proper styling, positioning, and layout üëç in one go!
